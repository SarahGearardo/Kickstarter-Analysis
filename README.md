# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project</br>

### Purpose</br>
The purpose of this project was to identify trends in Kickstarter data in order to assist Louise in launcing her theater campaign at the best time and with the correct goal to have a high chance of success.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date</br>
When analyzing the outcomes of theater campaigns based on Launchdate, it was determined that theater campaigns launced in May perform the best before steadily tapering off to the lowest performing month of December. If Louise wants the best possible outcome for her campaign, I would suggest launching it in May so she has the best chances of it being successful.</br>

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals</br>
When analyzing the oucomes of campaigns based on goals, it was found that the most successful campaigns had a goal of less than $1,000.00. There is also a significant amount of successful campaigns with goals between $35,000.00 to $44,999.00, however, anything more than that sharply drop off. It is also determined that the higher the goal, the more percentage chance you have of failure. Campaigns asking between $45,000.00 and $49,000.00 had a 100% failure rate. I would suggest that Louise try to keep her budget modest in order to have the best chance at success by sticking to a goal between $0 and $5,000.00. If she must ask for more than $5,000.00, I would suggest sticking to the $35,000.00 to $44,999.00 range to have a better chance at a successtul campaign.</br>

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered</br>
Some challenges and difficulties encourtered was working with a large amount of different data and configuring it to match what Louise needed. Out of the fourteen columns on the spreadsheet, we ended up having to convert some of the data to read better and use that data to make easy to digest tables and charts. With the addition of converting and moving things around, there is more room for human error in the data set, however, I was able to overcome it by using my available resources and double checking my work.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?</br>
  - Two conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date is that launching a campaign in May has the best chance of success, while launching a campaign in December has the worst chance of success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?</br>
  - What I can conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals is that the higher the goal amount, the more likely the campaign is to fail, unless your goal is set between $35,000.00 to $44,999.00, then the percentage of success increases , while the percentage of failure decreases.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - This data only included a small amount of Kickstarter campaigns that were launched and concluded years ago. If we had a more updated data set, we could see if the trends still hold true to this day. If we used more up-to-date data and ignored data from before 2016, we could have a better chance at recognizing recent trends.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - We could create a graph based on spotlighted/staff picked Kickstarter Campaigns. Did the spotlighted/staff picked campaigns perform better than the ones that didn't? Maybe finding out that data could help Louise find out how to get her campaign spotlighted/staff picked if she needed it.
